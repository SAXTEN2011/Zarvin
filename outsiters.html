                <div>
                    <p>I think the quote perfectly shows a reoccurring theme: Conformity is not required. This is shown in many places. Darry not wearing a greaser haircut. Ponyboy keeping an academic record, and he and johnny not committing crimes. And later, realising fighting solves nothing. And yet, all of these people are accepted, and in johnny's case, almost idolised, or put in a position of leadership in Darry's case.  </p>

                <p>
                    This even more supports the theme. During a pivotal moment in the story, the theme is rehashed, and was spoken by a large character. The theme is clear. Conformity is not required. Johnny used his final breath to tell Ponyboy not to conform, not to be influenced in a negative way. It is obvious that Johnny strongly believed this, if he used it as his final word.

                            The theme of “The Outsiders” is obvious: “Conformity is not required.” This is shown in a large variety of places in the book, many obvious, but some more discrete. Darry not wearing the greaser haircut shows the theme. He doesn’t conform. He goes against the group, but isn’t criticized at all. In fact, the opposite happens. It is not because of his refusal to conform, but rather that he works, and is responsible, and the haircut is a product of that, and it is respected. The gang values Pony’s grades, and his innocence. In chapter 12, Two-Bit pleads Pony not to end up like the rest of the gang. He specifically asks for Pony not to harden. Johnny does the same, using his final breath to warn him against it. The rest of the gang hardened. Why shouldn’t Pony? They realised pony has more potential to be something other than a lifelong greaser living in the “hood.” They see the value in innocence, and encourage not conforming. Dally, the worst of them all, begs and pleads Johnny to stay out of jail, as it hardens someone. The rest of the gang hardened. Why shouldn’t Johnny? They realised conforming is unhelpful. They realised conforming to the bad mold set is detrimental. They discourage conformity. The theme could not be clearer.

                <h2>
                    Conformity In Teenagers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conformity is very frequent in teens. All people want to fit in, they desire to be liked, and accepted. To quote Rita Mae Brown, “I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.” This perfectly shows the problem teens face. Should they conform and be liked, or stay true to themselves? “The Outsiders” says to stay true to yourself, but is that applicable to a real world scenario? I believe not. In a job interview, someone in a suit and a natural hair color, I feel, would find far more success in getting a job than someone with green hair and a t-shirt. Conformity sometimes, seems to be required. I believe conformity makes you lose a bit of yourself, but it is necessary. The theme is very applicable to the average teen, but I do not agree with it.

                    While you lose a bit of yourself. It is necessary. "The Outsiders", however, takes an opposite stance. Saying that that piece lost is as valuable as any.
